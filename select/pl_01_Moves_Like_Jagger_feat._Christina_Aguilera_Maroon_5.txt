Just shoot for the stars, if it feels right
Then aim for my heart, if you feel like
And take me away, make it okay
I'll swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I make it
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit, and it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til your drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scared, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe,
that I've got the key, oh
So get in the car,
we can ride it wherever you want
Get inside it, and you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears, I'll take it from here
Oh yeah yeah, and it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til your drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
You wanna know, how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I shore my secret,
you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this yeah
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, uh baby, rub me right
But if I share my secret,
you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, oh yeah yeah
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til your drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
