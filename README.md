[00:07.51] There's something about my ego, tell her back up, Tim Tebow
[00:11.38] Got Tivo up in the ride, I'm leanin' back and my seat low
[00:15.07] You need those, I just sex em, bend the ass like Beckham
[00:18.69] Undress em, respect em, just for the night, then after that I forget them
[00:22.51] Neglected, I'm sorry girl, turn the house into a party world
[00:26.40] Probably gonna get herself played, Atari
[00:28.32] No time for tears, if you cryin' call Maury
[00:30.59] Got girls by the army, feelin' kinda horny
[00:32.66] Love it when I'm on a Benny Blanc beat
[00:34.22] Talk cheap, but I spend big
[00:35.73] 'Cause I
[00:39.73] 
[00:36.55] Just shoot for the stars
[00:38.90] If it feels right
[00:40.31] Then aim for my heart
[00:42.74] If you feel like it
[00:44.20] Take me away, and make it okay
[00:47.84] I swear I'll behave
[00:57.34] 
[00:51.62] You wanted control
[00:53.87] So we waited
[00:55.41] I put on a show
[00:57.63] Now we're naked
[00:59.12] You say I'm a kid
[01:00.93] My ego is big
[01:02.81] I don't give a shit
[01:06.14] And it goes like this
[01:16.64] 
[01:08.48] Take me by the tongue
[01:09.60] And I'll know you
[01:12.18] Kiss me till you're drunk
[01:13.48] And I'll show you
[01:21.98] 
[01:14.86] All them moves like jagger
[01:16.44] I've got the moves like jagger
[01:18.39] I've got the moves like jagger
[01:33.39] 
[01:23.44] I don't need try to control you
[01:27.11] Look into my eyes and I'll own you
[01:44.11] 
[01:29.79] With them the moves like jagger
[01:31.55] I've got the moves like jagger
[01:33.32] I've got the moves like jagger
[01:48.32] 
[01:37.02] Maybe it's hard
[01:39.04] When you feel like you're broken and scarred
[01:42.68] Nothing feels right
[01:44.04] But when you're with me
[01:45.98] I make you believe
[01:47.84] That I've got the key
[01:58.34] 
[01:51.54] So get in the car
[01:54.09] We can ride it
[01:55.39] Wherever you want
[01:57.65] Get inside it
[01:59.14] And you want to steer
[02:00.91] But I'm shifting gears
[02:02.93] I'll take it from here (oh yeah, yeah)
[02:06.16] And it goes like this
[02:16.66] 
[02:08.45] Take me by the tongue
[02:09.75] And I'll know you
[02:12.10] Kiss me 'til you're drunk
[02:13.46] And I'll show you

[02:39.54] Say I got them moves
[02:41.36] I was a rolling stone, girls call my phone
[02:43.12] Let it ring, I'm way too cool
[02:44.66] Get a little bit of dome when I'm in arenas
[02:46.68] Messin' with these ho's that be so eager
[02:48.76] But no need to tease her
[02:50.75] I'ma go on with Christina
[03:03.25] 
[02:53.43] So watch and learn
[02:55.24] I won't show you twice
[02:57.40] Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
[03:00.98] And if I share my secret
[03:02.74] You're gonna have to keep it
[03:04.69] Nobody else can see this
[03:16.69] 
[03:08.13] And it goes like this
[03:10.38] Take me by the tongue
[03:11.61] And I'll know you
